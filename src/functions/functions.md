# Functions Introduction

Functions are the fundamental building block of any application in JavaScript. Theyâ€™re how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules. In TypeScript, while there are classes, namespaces, and modules, functions still play the key role in describing how to *do* things. TypeScript also adds some new capabilities to the standard JavaScript functions to make them easier to work with.
